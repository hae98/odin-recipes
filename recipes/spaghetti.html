        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Make Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add meat and cook
                until browned, about 8 minutes. As meat cooks, use spoon to break
                it up into smaller pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Add onions and cook, stirring every once in a while, until softened,
                about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, and oregano and cook, stirring
                continuously for about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Pour in the water and stir in the tomatoes and a pinch of salt and black pepper.
                Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 23 minutes.
                As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times and adjust seasoning accordingly.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cook Spaghetti</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring large pot 
                of salted water to a boil, and then cook pasta according to package
                directions.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Finish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the sauce off the heat, and then stir in the basil.
                Toss in the cooked pasta, and let rest for minute. Toss again and serve
                 with parmesan sprinkled on top.
            </li>
        </ol>
